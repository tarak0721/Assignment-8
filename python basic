1. Is the Python Standard Library included with PyInputPlus?
 PyInputPlus is not a part of the Python Standard Library, so you must install it separately using Pip
2. Why is PyInputPlus commonly imported with import pyinputplus as pypi?
 pypi is alias of PyInputPlus. The as pyip code in the import statement saves us from typing pyinputplus each time we want to call a PyInputPlus function. Instead we can use the shorter pyip name
3. How do you distinguish between inputInt() and inputFloat()?
 The inputInt() function returns an integer, while the inputFloat() function returns a float value. 
4. Using PyInputPlus, how do you ensure that the user enters a whole number between 0 and 99?
 In the inputint function we can set the min = 0 and max =99 to ensure user enters number between 0 and 99
5. What is transferred to the keyword arguments allowRegexes and blockRegexes?
 We can also use regular expressions to specify whether an input is allowed or not. The allowRegexes and blockRegexes keyword arguments take a list of regular expression strings to determine what the PyInputPlus function will accept or reject as valid input.
6. If a blank input is entered three times, what does inputStr(limit=3) do?
 It will throw RetryLimitException exception.
7. If blank input is entered three times, what does inputStr(limit=3, default='hello') do?
 When you use limit keyword arguments and also pass a default keyword argument, the function returns the default value instead of raising an exception
